slide 0:

GEGL is a library originally started in 2000 by Rhythm and Hues in Hollywood to
bring GIMP higher bit depth than 8 bit and a new modular engine. It powers
the coming GIMP 2.10 release as well as other tools reusing its components.

slide 1:

GEGL's uses of multiple threads is now on by default. But the OpenCL code paths
are not. Intel's OpenCL implementation (Beignet) gives correct results, but is
slower than using multiple CPU threads, and the NVidia drivers yield unexpected
and unacceptable results for many operations.

Babl, GEGL's and GIMP's pixel format description and conversion library got native
support for using ICC v2/v4 matrix+TRC profiles, and it is more than 10 times
faster than using stock LittleCMS v2 for the conversions.

slide 2:

Development has accelerated in the last year, with almost monthly releases,
more commits, and a high rate of bugs being fixed.

A stable API-frozen release that can power a very backwards compatible
GIMP 2.10.x series is coming.
